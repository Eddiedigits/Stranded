    Our sensors do not indicate our area as an immminent risk zone. The trajectories of these outer-planet objects are all in that distance.

Vika's spaceship, which is the parent spaceship of our - Leo's and mine - pods, landed upon a clearing in this jungle. Her ride was more smooth than ours. Too smooth by her description, while we almost became wrecks. The AI of this spaceship decided to distribute the risk of losing too many personnel by dispersing us to a wide area. Weird decision, in my opinion. Since we are missing 2 others that our compass doesn't show. Maybe they are what we almost became: wrecks. Everyone should have a compass to reach out to the others, to any others. I hope, we will find out the reason it decided to let us spread out. But for now, the AI is silent. It does sometimes; I have heard, it is to avoid us degenerating our brains, i.e. to keep our neuronal activities steady. I can hope, it - the AI -will  decide to tell us soon enough if our situation turns sticky. Yet, for now, we can assume, there is no imminent danger. Also, it keeps silent about the other stranded. Weird policy.

Alas, what will we do?

<<say "Vika">>Honestly, as a pilot, I can say that we cannot connect to the mothership. In fact. there is nothing but static. So, I conclude the mothership is unreachable or no more. Also, I do not reach the others; the other stranded.
My suggestion is therefore: As we only have 5 unimatter, we print a transmission mast, look for an optimal elevation and reach out to the others..<</say>>

Only 5 unimatter?! That sucks! That means, I have to strategize wisely.

<<say "Leo">><em>groan</em> I would hoard food. What Vika said doesn't sound good. I fear, we are stuck here. At least for a while.
Oh, by the dark universe! Please, give us hope!
Ah, ye'. I would like to repair myself and have a substance analyzer.<</say>>

Oh, I do not have much problems being stuck here for a while. <em>glancing at Vika</em>
But then again ... if we are stuck here for long ... food/energy is essential. A substance analyzer enables us to know which things are edible or can be used as materials, like unimatter.

[img[assets/backgrounds/Placeholder.png]]/* Arrival at Camp Jungle */
 
  With the protection of the night, we were departing for the Jungle Camp. It was not an easy ride, always on alert, on our toes. Even as our flight didn't took more than 15 minutes - we took a huge curved flight path, evading the hotspot -, we didn't know whether I made the right choice. What's more is that we have absolutely no data whether the air in the night is free of hostiles. 

  But fortuna is on our side. Nothing happened. And weirdly nothing was in the air, not a flying thing - animal nor ship -, no radio messages. Too silent for my taste.

  <<if $token != 1>><<if $CampM.nutrients > 0>>Leo is waving us and greet us happily, relieved. He shortly introduces himself to the ladies and proposes to postpone the introductions. All agree. W<<else>>Leo is saluting me and immediately w<</if>>e carry Vika to the spaceship and dock her inside the spaceship to activate the recuperation protocol. As it is done ... What? Yes, so much effort for just a bit of carrying and indocking that just took no more than 10 minutes. As I was saying: as it is done, we assessed the scenery anew. Leo did a job! Most of the scraps is collected and the important things are done in a short time.

  We made us ourselves known and talk about our situation, of what we all know so far. But it is late. We go to sleep and hope that there won't be nightly surprises.

  <<ab>>[[Go to sleep|A New Cycle][$QuestPool.pushUnique($Q1C0, $Q1CA, $Q1CA1, $Q1CA2, $Q1CB, $Q1CC); $phases = 0]]<</ab>>
  <<elseif $token == 1>>
    We landed safely on the camp and waited many minutes for any incomings. The sensors all are indicating the usual. No tremors. It takes us much more minutes to calm ourselves to a point where we dare to go to sleep. Abiba volunteers to be on the cockpit until morning. But Elva insist that she should wake her up in 4 hours. Abiba shrugs. 

    Hopefully, we won't have any nightly surprises.

  Elva and Abiba's ship return. It hasn't attacked them. If their watcher knows what that was that attacked us?

  On a spot of a mountainous area, I found another spaceship - like ours! Another stranded. 

  But it is silent. I try to direct-radio them, even knocking on the hatch - which is quite brutally deformed. But no reaction. 
  
  <div id="theHatch">What do I do?

  <<ab>>Returning is not an option, but then what is?<</ab>>

  <<timed 10s>><<replace "#theHatch">>Wait! What is ... the hatch! <em>Wow</em> It is opening painfully, with loud crashing and creaking sounds. Surely audible wide and far. Hopefully, whatever attacked her, is very much in the distance. <em>Whether it was the same that attacked us?</em> The hatch is hanging, as it tried open completely it swings. The hinge is bent.
  
  Anyway, it is far enough to jump in and <<linkappend "check it out.">>

    Ok! There are two ladies in the cryostasis <<set $QuestPool.pushUnique($Q1CD), $noAbiba = true, $noElva = true>>, as they apparently couldn't find food and even had unsucessful energy consuming flights around this area. Their guardian, the watcher didn't help much as probably recommending the ladies to go to sleep. Never find I myself in such a stark contrast to our AIs here than anytime in my life. Does it need to save energy, or? 
    Bueno, enough complaining. This ship is not what I hoped for, but still can serves us. Well then, <<linkappend "to the cockpit.">>

  Yes! There are others! The ladies greet me in surprise and ask me from where I do come, which spaceship number is it, why didn't I radio them. I ask them that their antenna works? They gesturing and answering: not always, it is weird. So I answered to them that <<if $CampJ.TransMast>>even though we built an antenna, we didn't received any incomings - we assume it is because of the dense jungle.<<else>>we hadn't found the time and the urgency to build an antenna. Until now.<</if>> So, what happened that I took a rather dangerous journey?

  <<say "RD">>Yes! I almost forgot! We were attacked. Whacked!<</say>>

  The ladies raises the eyebrows, opens the eyes, slightly open the mouth as I tell them what happened. As in to realize that they, we, are not in a safe environment anymore. Or dreading more if they also had their encounters.

  <<say "Elva">>Then let us go there. You know the way.<</say>>

If you are wondering, how we - in cylinders - are fighting? Well, our exosuits are mostly mechanical, which is still necessary for us to finetune the coordination between brain and limbs. If our AI has the command, then ... well ... let us say ... they have ... what we would call personalities too. Also, in low-data situations, it is down to luck and chance. Better die by my own choice.
And for other reasons, as: to counteract brain degeneration and for energy efficiency.

Leo is taken aback, then a bit affronted.

He is gesticulating with a shrugged shoulder, swirled with his uplifted hand and tilted slighty his head.

<<say "Elva">>Fine, I guess, it is your right since you are out there the most of the time.<</say>>

I thank Elva with a nod. Then look at Abiba, but she only stares at me, rather a bit darkly.

<<say "RD">>Yes, I know, it is kind of a lottery. As a compromise, I will explore more. But if I didn't found anything, we do our plan. Agreed?<</say>>

Abiba looks sideways, grinds her left teeth while the others do not veto. Leo looks at me with his mouth wrinkle far on his side. Then all of them nod.

<<say "RD">>Difficult to say. I mean, such a device, completed off our network, solely isolated, simplified. Such a thing cannot do much harm, can it?<</say>>

I ask the engineering ladies. Vika and Abiba are between weighing and nodding their heads.

We all scatter except for Vika. She sits still there lost in thoughts and with a serious sceptic face, even shaking subtly her head time to time.

- if you detected Unimatter in the North (2 tiles),
- if you detected the beach in the West (no events in the west, 5 tiles, rather unimportant)
- if you detected the camp in the mountains in the East (4 tiles)
- if you detected the energy balls in the South (3 tiles)
- if you had all interactions with the ladies (8xE, 11xA & 12xV)

Plans:
- more events (more variety)
- one more lady (or more people)
- expanded exploration (more tiles and events)
- possibility to extend, upgrade and manage tech, components and buildings (per aspera ad astra) for finding out the mysteries
- if possible: more events with the current ladies
- sophisticated gameplay (missions, quests, feedback)

Since, luckily, I had the compass, I did not spend too much energy. Which gave us an optimal total balance (no forgetti! We are practically machines, too) for a fly.
We found two spots on the mountaineous ridge, one for parking, the other one for the antenna. Both in visible distance. 
It didn't take long after the installation of the antenna until we established contact to another group of stranded, but like us, not in a lucky number: 2 of 5. The small spaceships is designed to house 5 pods with 10 maximum energy and 5x10 cycles of nutrients. With two spaceships, we have a total of 20 energy now.

After opening a virtual space, it didn't took long for them to enter.

<<say "RD">>Ladies and Gentleman. Thank you ... <</say>>

<<say "Elva">>Huh? Why so formal?<</say>>

I look at Elva, make a gesture and mimic as I do not know either.

<<say "RD">>Fine. Then I get to the point: What do we do with the info that we, or I, were attacked?<</say>>

Vika shudders a bit, changing her position to more encapsulating.

<<say "Elva">>It didn't attack us anew. So, either we do all right or it will happen again.<</say>>

<<say "Vika">>After reliving of what happened again and again, I think it is intelligent.<</say>>

<<say "RD">>I know right.<</say>>

<<say "Leo">>What makes you both think so?<</say>>

<<say "Vika">>By the fact that it didn't killed us. Well, it almost killed me. I do not know ... well, compared to the animals, it seemt to be very precise and exact, as it knew where to hit.<</say>>

That is it! That's the concrete feeling I had after the pullback, the back-to-ground-stomp. 
The others are not that convinced, though spooked by such a possibility.

<<say "RD">>Then ... you were the most dangerous one for it to have almost killed you!<</say>>

<<say "Vika">>Maybe. It could have killed me, but it decided rather to weaken me or to neutralize me.&nbsp;<em>Mfh!</em>&nbsp;I do not know. It is indeed that we know almost nothing about it.<</say>>

<<say "Abiba">>Would it be wise to poke on a beehive?<</say>>

Mixed with surprise that Abiba spoke and with what she said, we - for many seconds - haven't said a word. She made us re-align to the original topic.

With a clicking sound, Leo initiates the talk anew.

<<say "Leo">>What would you do?<</say>>

<<say "Abiba">>Continue on trying to find others and a way to contact our mothership. Let ... the thing be. No more crossing over the zone.<</say>>

<<say "RD">>It was all fine until I used the Orb to scan the spaceship. The spaceship overgrown by plants.<</say>>

<<say "Abiba">>Then no more orbs. We can do it without it.<</say>>

We all squirm.

<<say "RD">>I say, we print ultra-small drones and slowly collect data.<</say>>

<<say "Abiba">>We do no such things! Didn't we agreed on no flying things?<</say>>

<<say "RD">>Well, we neither agreed nor vetoed.<</say>>

<<say "Abiba">>Avoid the hotspot at all cost, no fliers. Only trying to find the others. Until we reach the mothership!<</say>>

<<say "Elva">>If it is intelligent, wouldn't it have us attacked again?<</say>>

<<say "Leo">>From the human perspective, we should have done, yes. But obviously, it is not. So, its decision factors may differ. But then again: we indeed know too less ... in fact: we have no data at all, except <<if $QuestPoolDone.includesAny($Q1A, $Q1B)>>our own memories<<else>>the record<</if>>.<</say>>

<<say "RD">>That makes you to which position? To which side?<</say>>

Leo looks at me, says nothing, ruminates.

<<say "Vika">>A middle ground?<</say>>

<<say "Elva">>Which is?<</say>>

Vika shakes her head and everyone is silent.

<<say "RD">>Fine. One ultra-small drone, no more?<</say>>

<<say "Abiba">>A'a!&nbsp;<em>gesturing determined</em>&nbsp;No!<</say>>

<<say "Elva">>Bien. How about the antenna?<</say>>

<<say "Vika">>Here? It doesn't seem to reach no one.<</say>>

<<say "Elva">>Weird. It is overreaching the canopies, is it not?<</say>>

<<say "Vika">>It is. It is even functional. There is just no reaction. It seems to reach no one.<</say>>

<<say "Elva">>But we were there on the mountains as you installed the antenna?<</say>>

Vika only looks at Elva, saying nothing, asking herself whether there is something she oversaw.

<<say "Elva">>If we build an antenna and a transmitter again on the mountain ridge? This time with your expertise? After we found ... well, after he&nbsp;<em>pointing towards me</em>&nbsp;found another route and spot?<</say>>

Vika has still her doubts. The ladies are competent enough. There must be another reason. 

<<say "Elva">>We try again? With Vika's expertise? Can we accept that, Abiba?<</say>>

Abiba is squirming. She would completely avoid the East at all.

<<say "Leo">>Gut! It is obvious: we need to find others! Be it other stranded or our mothership. That is: genereally explore more until he stumbles upon others plus an alternative route to the mountain ridge and build a new antenna?<</say>>

The ladies nod and shrug.

<<say "Leo">>Agreed?<</say>>

<<say "RD">>Hold on! What about my approach?<</say>>

<<say "Leo">>Then: vote it is.<</say>>

Leo and his voting! <em>hrgh</em>

Everyone nods, 

Alright, which will I choose?

<<say "blackface">>Yes. Tell me, you have good news!<</say>>

<<say "blackface">>Laksmana. Just an update. That we will inspect the warehouse from the outside.<</say>>

<<say "blackface">>Baik, mengerti. Be careful. Be on guard. I fear, we have another player here. Another force.<</say>>

<<say "blackface">>... ok ... understood<</say>>

The Laksmana is looking intently to his human senior security engineer, which is kind of a paramanager to the AI management of security. She is a bit perplexed as of why the Laksmana stares at her intently without saying any words. But it shouldn't take long for her to grasp. Time will tell who or what is the assumed "third" player.

<<say "blackface">>Frustrating!<</say>>

That's the big spacecruiser. Made for voyaging from Earth to other galaxies. A big Chunker, that one. Many boasted engineering feats werde done to enable a better inter-galactical travel. Hopefully it won't become our titanic. Ha haaa. But, inter galactic travel is still a long journey. Therefore it is practically a ferrying city, with all its typical elements: bakery, cafeteria, park, university, club, city hall, residential area, apartments, restaurants etc. You get the gist. 

What about Family? Friends? In a way they travel with me, as virtual clones. Same with me, a virtual clone with them, updated in cycles. Funnily, if I rather want not much contact, I virtually clone myself. With time they notice, depending how investive they were to me. Clearly, we do not have endless storage, even in the universe.

Aaand ignition!

...

Come on, that what you see is only the postbot. What tomfoolery would that be to catapult a huge spacewhale out of our solar system from the earthen soil! And no, I am sitting - stacked - in a commuter; on the way to the big chunker that is anchored nearby Mercure. If ready, the big chunker will float to the gateway, that will bend time and space to sling the big chunker out of the solar system. 

Its destination: Alpha Centauri. A stellar system recently established by probes and first pioneers. All criteria are within tolerable parameters and three planets are get go for colonization by Homo Solaris. 
The project, the voyage, is the biggest of its kind, but also probably one of the last. You see, sending practically a "country" with its living inhabitants has become too huge, too risky and it takes too much time. A new approach is in transaction: Sending only sophisticated printers that upon arrival initiates a waking protocol, which is usually goes in by first sending a status feedback to Solaris Hub, then by printing sensors, a vessel, AI and at last human brains. What happens after, depends on the systemic situation. Much more economic, energy-savvy, faster and safer that way.

Whether the chunker has a name? Enough of reading "big chunker"? Fine, the name of this mobile polymer-ceramic half-moon: Big Chunker!
Hahaa, do not tell me we have humour!

...

Fine, it is: SOLARIS' BLESSING.
<<timed 52s>><<audio "V7" play>><</timed>>
So. 
In this journey, in the virtual city I will enjoy going out, meet people, have dates. Only to be met by frustrations and dissappointments. And, on top of all, my prof will force me to cram, cram, cram. Äääch! Hippiyay. Too much cramming cannot be good, so I go out anew, meet people, have fun, all as much my hormones allows me. Aaaand the cycle repeats: frustrations, dissappointments, cramming. 

It is a big wonder with our technological advancements that we do not live in an neverending bliss.

That's me at birth. Cute, eh? Arms and Legs are missing, though. They come later. Why in virtual age do we need a complete organic body? We are connected to the cloud, internet, parallel world, peer-to-peer. Countries are practically virtual now. Borders? Nah, firewalls.

And since we are in the future, or like in the past, every technology is subject to evolution. Despite of advanced technology, no entity - except of (maybe) the universe - has unlimited data storage. Professionals are still in demand like in every time.

<div class="text" style="width:50vw">Hello. Hola. Moin. Salve. 

Huzzah! My first game!

This game is designed for desktop and mobile version. The sidebar therefore is only for rollback, saving, loading and restarting. As I tested many times, I am satisfied with the outcome. Although I fear, some skewed layout will happen to some of you. Hopefully not you, eh. Anyway, if you want to support me by giving me feedbacks, ideas, suggestions, co-authoring, tips, corrections etc., please do: pi.nola@tutanota.com.

IMPORTANT:

The game has erotic elements. But they are pretty vanilla for me. No fetishes or kinks. And don't get me started with Futas, maldición! So, as obviously, you should be at the age of your country to consume erotica. If you are not, you may enjoy this game by going the SFW-route.

---- WARNING: LOOOOOOONG TEXT ----

<<say "Vika">>Are you from the first generation?<</say>>

<<say "Paavali">>Niin. The one and only.<</say>>

<<say "Vika">>How many were of you.<</say>>

Paavali is rubbing his nose.

<<say "Paavali">>Around 100 people, including only-brains.<</say>>

<<say "Elva">>Only brains?<</say>>

<<say "Paavali">>Brains in a biiig facility. But. They were with Kapteyn Hub. Or still are. You have seen the hub?<</say>>

All of us shake our head. Paavali chirruped, then waved it away and gestures that he is ready for more.

<<say "RD">>What is this thing? You said, it is a silver carpet?<</say>>

<<say "Elva">>No no! What is it about the brains!? They do not have ... a torso oooor ... limbs?<</say>>

<<say "Paavali">>Niin. Is correct. They live completely virtual, alongside an AI. They also were mostly awake throughout the journey. Depending on the energy quantity. While us were in cryonics, they - or some of them - were managing, fixing, improvising and keeping in contact with Solaris.<</say>>

<<say "Vika">>You volunteered?<</say>>

<<say "Paavali">>Me? Or us? Yeah, yeah, ok, I kind of volunteered, the others more or less.<</say>>

<<say "Elva">>How so? Anyone were forced?<</say>>

<<say "Paavali">>Not at gunpoint, that to say. But economically, financially, by keeping the family, by incentives, by lack of alternatives. All in all, many of us decided to come here.<</say>>

<<say "Vika">>What about other probes? Were they composed like yours? And how many did Solaris sent out?<</say>>

<<say "Paavali">>Oooph. We were around ... the 60th or 50th?<</say>>

<<say "Vika">>Composed like yours?<</say>>

<<say "Paavali">>I guess so. Why not?<</say>>

Vika look at him critically, gives him no answer though.

<<say "RD">>Can we talk about the thing?<</say>>

Paavali turned his head, but his eyes are still on Vika's. He is pointing towards her, asking us. 

<<say "RD">>Silver Carpet!<</say>>

Paavali gives some lingering on Vika then focuses on my question.

<<say "Paavali">>Yeah, yeah, ok. Uhh ... yeah. Hopeamatto. Or officially: the Titan. Yeah, well, we agreed that it a ... being. Almost sentient. Almost in the sense that obviously it can withstand harder external forces, contrary to us. It is <strong>very</strong> observant. It is intelligent.<</say>>

<<say "Abiba">>How so?<</say>>

Paavali stretched his underlip up, combed his beard with his hand.

<<say "Paavali">>It sent us messages.<</say>>

We all reacted surprised. Amazed. Then with nervousness.

<<say "Abiba">>And?<</say>>

<<say "Elva">>Hold on! Was it before or after?<</say>>

Paavali stares at her, Addled as to what Elva was referring to. As Leo wants to help, Paavali is already asking back.

<<say "Paavali">>You mean: before or after the deep slumber, the sleep mode?<</say>>

<<say "Elva">>Yes.<</say>>

He raises his eyebrow, swayed his head leftward and back.

<<say "Paavali">>After.<</say>>

Now, we are more surprised and amazed.

<<say "Abiba">>Ok. Wow. How? And what did the message say?<</say>>

<<say "Paavali">>Sometimes, to save more energy or if something is wrong - well, obviously we all were in a state of inertia, of doing nothing. Machines, hardwares, us, have their life periods. As long as possible but not for eternity. Anyway, sometimes our ship gets attacked and some of us have to repair with what we have. Up until the moment where we had to do hard decisions.<</say>>

<<say "Abiba">>Killing those in cryonics?!<</say>>

<<say "Paavali">>Whoa! We were in a desperate situation, yes, I mean ... we even had ...<</say>>

He couldn't continue on, he is lost in memory, chewing on his underlip, with a worrying facial expression.

<<say "Abiba">>You killed.<</say>>

<<say "Paavali">>Hei!<</say>>

<<say "Abiba">>Did you not or did you?!<</say>>

Whoa! Abiba pierces with her eyes on him, demanding intently an answer from him.

<<say "Paavali">>I did not.<</say>>

She searches him for any sign of a lie.

<<say "Paaval">>I would have, but someone else did. Killed. Or neutralized. In a way of tearing off their limbs. As to why: They wanted to shut off the cryonics of the others while we rather vote-agreed to wake them up and give them a chance.<</say>>

Now he has our attention more so than ever before.

<<say "Paavali">>But fate decided otherwise. The aggressive monster ran into us, crushed and rammed and bited and ... ugh, a mess! Guys, I tell ya, voi hyvänen aika! At the end, only me and two other were mostly unscathed. The others were no more or had to go to their cryonics caskets or to med. And a ship further damaged.<</say>>

Hm. The ship I saw? It seemt in a good state. What is going on? It doesn't feel like he is lying, or acting up.

<<say "Paavali">>Now, we had to wake them all, hold a council and do hard to swallow decisions.<</say>>

Paavali does a pause, fidgeting with his fingers, concentrating at a patch of grass. 

<<say "RD">>Come on!<</say>>

Without looking up, he continues on.

<<say "Paavali">>Then it came.<</say>>

Now, all our eyes are open.

<<say "Paavali">>Sent us an offer: to enter it.<</say>>

<<say "RD">>To enter it?<</say>>

<<say "Paavali">>Yeah, we didn't knew either what it meant by that, until we got the idea. That was as it was repairing and stabilizing those in critical state, or slighty fixed the rest of us, but around three who were deemed hopeless, it ... swallowed them. Incorporated them. At that moment, we kind of knew what the offer meant. And obviously all of us refuse.<</say>>

A pause again. What is he? A bard? He should continue on, he is enojying this, I fear.

<<say "Paavali">>Until, around two or three days, as some decided their luck in the wilderness or wanted to sleep to oblivion or just waited, we were having visitations. Virtually. From those three. They were telling us what a huge world there awaits, a kind of a paradise in waiting, in making, or just a world - for us sceptics. Virtual nonetheless, But also it wanted us to keep biological.<</say>>

<<say "Abiba">>Well, if it was tempting you all, it is kind of bad.<</say>>

Abiba. Speaking so much, in such an interest. Emotionally invested. Huh.

<<say "Paavali">>Or kind of honest. Consquently, more and more accepted the offer and let themselves be assimilated into the silver carpet. Or the Titan.<</say>>

<<say "Leo">>What convinced them?<</say>>

<<say "Paavali">>I mean, it is virtual. And a world into making. Just use your fantasies, and it will be done.<</say>>

<<say "Leo">>But isn't it metallic?<</say>>

<<say "Paavali">>Mainly. Since we observed animals observing us, completely inanimate for daaays! It was kind of clear to us that those were not original animals. They were made.<</say>>

Whoa! Now that sets us to a completely new level. That ...

<<say "Leo">>That would explain ... many things.<</say>>

Now Leo, and the others too, are staring, looking at Paavali.

<<say "Paavali">>I am one of last ones. No. I mean: the ones who never accepted ... accepts the offer, as it is still standing.<</say>>

<<say "Vika">>Why?<</say>>

Paavali looks at Vika with intense eyes.

<<say "Paavali">>Because I don't believe in paradise. In a world of eternal blessing. There is always something to pay, to sacrifice, to tribute, to suffer. Yin and Yang. Duality. Two poles.<</say>>

He said those with such a consentration, with a sincerity, with a seriousness that put us in a bit of awe, even as it is cheesy, kitschy, schlocky. But considering that all of them believed in it. Wait! 

<<say "RD">>Can they communicate? Communicate with you?<</say>>

<<say "Paavali">>Yes. And that is the other reason. For not going in. Some of them proposed that some of us biologics should stay original. Even if some are trying to ... not decouple, but be a loose unit. They say, their "overseer" kind of is learning the individuality. Now they say: decentralization. Now they work on a link to a biological product.<</say>>

<<say "Leo">>What?!<</say>>

<<say "Paavali">>Yeah!<</say>>

<<say "Leo">>No! I didn't understood what you were trying to say. Biological product? As in producing ... animals?<</say>>

<<say "Paavali">>That is what I understood.<</say>>

<<say "Abiba">>Then the aggressive animal is its product!?<</say>>

<<say "Paavali">>Some asked that too. But we believe it is not, at most it can incluence it, but it doesn't control them.<</say>>

<<say "Elva">>Where are the others? The others who didn't "enter". Where are they?<</say>>

<<say "Paavali">>In cryonics. It is only four of us. Enough energy that way. And we rotate every year.<</say>>

<<say "RD">>You said your ship were damaged. Wrecked?<</say>>

<<say "Paavali">>Yes. ... Voi, kyllä. Our ship looks like it is repaired? That what you refer to?<</say>>

I nod.

<<say "Paavali">>With the help of those inside the Titan spits some ressources that enabled us to repair the ship eventually.<</say>>

<<say "Vika">>Then you must be able to launch now? And! Are you in contact with the Kapteyn Hub?!<</say>>

<<say "Paavali">>...<</say>>

<<say "Vika">>Are you!?<</say>>

Vika looks like as she is about to jump. Paavali stares back at her, obviously raking his brain on how to answer. Now that will be something that will bother us.

<<say "Paavali">>We are.<</say>>

Huh?! He is?! He is in contact with the hub?  We all are happy, but also dazzled.

<<say "Paavali">>Although ...<</say>>

I knew it! And probably not only me as well.

<<say "Paavali">>... we never got messages back from Solaris since our deep sleep mode, even that answers takes some years. But it is too long now.<</say>>

...

<<say "Leo">>Foul Play?<</say>>

Paavali weighs his whole body, weighing his shoulders, saying that he even himself doesn't know for sure.

<<say "Elva">>Maybe Solaris intentionally doesn't reply?<</say>>

We all ponder, but it feels weak, this argument.

<<say "Paavali">>Can I ask you guys?<</say>>

We all slowly gaze at him.

<<say "Paavali">>Nuori veitikka here says: you are not the sent corps? Or: you do not know of such things?<</say>>

We confirm.

<<say "Paavali">>To where were you destined?<</say>>

<<say "RD">>Alpha Centauri.<</say>>

<<say "Paavali">>Again?<</say>>

<<say "RD">>We are the third wave. Third wave of colonizers.<</say>>

Paavali kneads his mouth, stretches his lips,

<<say "RD">>Anyway, that explains why we had to put in cryonics. That our journey took another double.<</say>>

Paavali looks at me. In a way that I can read that he has a premonition.

<<say "RD">>Paavali. What is it?<</say>>

He stares at me, obviously weighing the arguments in his head. Obviously he cannot speak it out. He grins, the grin of a dilemma. Then he shakes his head.

<<say "Paavali">>Ok, kaverit. You know where I am. Let us keep in contact. Yeah?<</say>>

<<say "Vika">>Hold on. How can you walk freely outside without any concern?<</say>>

<<say "Paavali">>The guarantee of our peers in the Titan.<</say>>

<<say "Vika">>And why don't we have a monolith?<</say>>

He answers by pointing with his index finger vigorously at Vika, grinning on his left face. But then he looks intently at me, as if he wants to warn me, to hint me to rake my brain, to understand of what he wants to say to me. I could feel that Leo noticed that too.
After Paavali were out of sight in the late afternoon horizon, Vika cast her doubts to trust him. We all nod more or less, no one protesting. 

But what was Paavali trying to hint?

  On a spot of a mountainous area, I found others! Yay! I guess, that is why the AI kept passive, because it knew, we will find the others ...

  Both damsels told me that they are less lucky. 3 others of their crewmates didn't make it since <<= $days>> cycles. Both alones make them feel rather lonely. They wish more company. I proposed, if possible, we will set a camp here. The more the merrier. They agreed without hesitation.

  I will go back and tell the others about the new option: the resettling to Camp Mountain.

[img[assets/backgrounds/Placeholder.png]]

<<say "blackface">>Waaait.<</say>>

Huh?! I turn my head back, but still ready to run. Also I notice no tremors. From where did it come from? The voice? 
There. I see a shape appearing. An old man, his hairs so white and long. And! It is still in its older version. More synthetic than cyborg. I look at him in bewilderment, but he walk so casually and non-threatening, even waving his hand.

<<say "Paavali">>So you can hear me.<</say>>

Ok. Obviously he doesn't have the automatic virtual link, where my generation see each other virtually in human forms, whereas he only sees my capsule and its mechanic limbs. I activate the hologram. It whirs up and after some seconds of warmup the hologram increments its resolution until the old man sees my face with its individual features.

<<say "Paavali">>Oh, nice! A human. I greet you. You are human, right? From Solaris, right?<</say>>

Why this question? Are there other aliens?

<<say "RD">>Yes.<</say>>

<<say "Paavali">>Perhana, too long since I had someone humanely. Are you the sent corps?<</say>>

<<say "RD">>A sent corps?<</say>

<<say "Paavali">>...<</say>>

<<say "Paavali">>Perkele! You know nothing?<</say>>

<<say "RD">>About?<</say>>

<<say "Paavali">>Oh no ...<</say>>

The old man puts his hand on his face and pulls it downwards, grimacing the facial skin downwards.

<<say "Paavali">>Then ... who are you, from where do you come from, are you alone, which spaceship?<</say>>

I say nothing, too flummoxed. As in what is he doing here, as obviously he must be from an older generation. I know Solaris sent many probes and first wave scouts to all corners from our solar galaxis. So many, I barely know all of them solely by the sheer number of them. I guess, this one is one of them first wave scouts.

<<say "RD">>Are you the first wave scouts?<</say>>

<<say "Paavali">>Niin<</say>>

Niin? What language is that? Ugh, since we do not have the automatic translator - energy saving methodology -, there will be many words unknown.

<<say "Paavali">>Right, I can see that you didn't understood me. I was saying: Yes, I am one of the scouts and explorers. Paavali my name.<</say>>

<<say "RD">>Wait! My orb and ... my orb were attacked. Why did y ... Why?<</say>>

<<say "Paavali">>Mh!<</say>>

The old man pucks his lips sideways, turns and tilts his head subtly and looks over my side.

<<say "Paavali">>Yeah, that would be Hopeamatto.<</say>>

I look at him, sensing something revealing, but also confirming my suspicion. And yes, it is.

<<say "Paavali">>Meaning: silver carpet. But he has another name.<</say>>

...

I look at the old man. The old man looks at me. 

<<say "RD">>And?<</say>>

<<say "Paavali">>I recommend you to build a data interpreter. A kind of a record player, reproducible for older versions.<</say>>

<<say "RD">>Why? Just send us me the data, the records.<</say>>

<<say "Paavali">>Nah, have a simple data interpreter. Also, I need to collect the hardware.<</say>>

Was he almost blinking his eye? As in to give me a hint? A warning? And he gesticulated like I shouldn't ask further. Huh ...

<<say "RD">>Ok, then ... but the Orb gets shot down ... ?<</say>>

He mimicked in the direction from where I come from. I concludes that is the spot where we meet again.

<<say "RD">>O'right, old man, there we meet again.<</say>>

<<say "Paavali">>Hei! Nuori veitikka.<</say>>

  We didn't set a time. But then, I felt like that it wasn't necessary. But he is from older generation, surely they do not know when someone nears. Shit. Do I have to go in again?

  Oh! No, I can see the storage. Kind of a bit hidden, but still visible since ... he knew I would walk on this way. Nice.

  Well then ... 

  But what if it is a bomb?

  Yeah, but it knows our location. So, why would it give us an explosive since it could destroy us again?

  But this time, it is an human. He may have a different agenda. He wasn't so joyish to see us after so ... probably yyyears! Not in the way I would react. 

  Then again, he seems to know ... the alien? Wasn't he rather casually mentioning it? In a tone of ... familiarity? Then, if both know each other, and coupled with the fact that it didn't attack us again, shouldn't I be on the safer side?

All pictures of these fine ladies should be seen all by having reached interactibility to around 6.

In case of wondering about the consistency of the images. We living virtual, so we all have preferences about hair lengths, skins, setting, age etc. 
Ah! Whatever, we get the idea, eh?!
...
What do I hear? Excuses?
Oi! No es mi culpa if the virtual composer does not understand my intentions. I mean, even between humans, communicating is hard. 
Listening. Reading. Is. HARD.
So! Take out your contact lenses or your glasses, and all is fine!

<center><blockquote>
[img[assets/backgrounds/Placeholder.png]]

Paavali stands before the defense perimeter, looking to us. In a distance, not visible immediately, unless he is moving.

<<say "Vika">>What is that?! Is that him?<</say>>

<<say "RD">>Paavali, yes.<</say>>

<<say "Vika>>Why is he here?<</say>>

He is waving.
I go to him, but cannot help wonder how he found us and how he seems to know about the defense perimeter as he is leaning with his stretched arm on a tree, 2 m before the staked sensor post. Paavali greets me and looks kind of under me. First it was confounding until I remember to activate my hologram. Then Paavali could look correctly into my eyes. He asks me whether we watched and listened through all. I silently nod, as I am sure he would have known since Vika glanced him. My silence is not unnoticed, Paavali mimicked a question whether all is good?

Not really. Before I went to him, I heard Vika stating that she read, heard, that all first wave probes were non-humans. At least, non-biological. As it was more economic since humans need to be in big groups, at least 200 of them. 

<<say "Leo">>Humans are known also to be discreet and secretive. Or he is not from the first wave?<</say>>

<<say "Vika">>Slipping under the eyes of Solaris?<</say>>

Leo asks me to ask Paavali. He grimaced humourously, sighed heavily.

<<say "Vika">>The data interpreter told us about biological humans!<</say>>

Leo agrees, remembering the detail.

<<say "Leo">>Right ...<</say>> 

<<say "Vika">>What does Paavali say?<</say>>

<<say "RD">>"Am I not proof enough?"<</say>>

<<say "Leo">>Sure that you are not ... that somewhere you are mixing up? Maybe a policy upon arrival? That no humans should set foot until it is confirmed? I mean, our watcher says there were biological humans.<</say>>

Vika is brooding. Heavily. 
Curious! She doesn't seem swayed.

Now Leo comes to me and greets Paavali. With a good mood he greets back. Internally, he asked us to let Paavali in. All of us, except Vika who is ignoring the vote, me agree with varying degrees. Paavali then walk with us to the ladies and greets them each individually. Only Vika says nothing, instead observing him.

Paavali opens his arms to the side, palms up.

Arrival at KAPTEYN'S STAR. A red dwarf star system. All sensors are active and scan for planetary bodies. Initial readings indicate the presence of at least two confirmed planets, Kapteyn b and Kapteyn c within our immediate vicinity, Kapteyn d and e were discovered some time later.
Superficial survey of all planets for potential habitability.
Kapteyn c revealed to be a potential habitable planet. With a restriction: This planet is plighted by meteorites bombardment. Constantly. The meteorite shower happened quite recently: around 50 years before the arrival, hence after the sendout. It happens since the orbit of a planet - Kapteyn d - is merging with its neighbor - Kapteyn e. Both began chafing each other around 50 years ago, sending detritus throughout the whole system.
Our orbital outpost has to initiate the evade maneuver three times.
It is calculated that this lush planet wouldn't die from the outer influence, only will have many setbacks. We baptized it as Bādhiccu, the plighted.</div>

Cartographed status of Badhiccu: 34,23%.
Badhiccu - or technically: Kapteyn c - teem with few carbon-based life-forms, mainly plants, strangely very few "animals". No one in our proximity demonstrated a degree in intelligence matched with humanity. Yet. 
Some plant-based entities are consumable or can be converted to consumables. Some even have completely unknown molecular structures, which are handled with caution, since their effects are not foreseeable at all.
After some cycles, our sensors indicates huge swathes of metallic compounds under badhiccan soil. Probably stretching in thousands of kilometers. Mainly made of titanium. And it is moving. 
Changing. 
Oscillating. 
Continually!
Upon excavating on a spot, it demonstrated high reactivity. Unusual for metallic compounds. At first, it emanated malleability and heat, then coldness and durability. Interestingly, the metallic surface progressively hardened as our driller continued anew and anew, revealing adaptive hardening. Changes within minutes! To be sure, excavations were repeated on other spots. They demonstrate all the same behavior: reactive changes in density. 
On excavation spot number 12, something happened: it spiked. It formed a kind of a stele ---</div>

I stretch out my arm, pointing to this fact while looking at the others. We look at each other, knowing now that it is the same that attacked our spaceship.

I hear a groaning from Vika. She is shaking her head, looking with such suspicion that makes us quite wonder.

Weirdly, it didn't answered on point. Vika asked again, and again it didn't answered satisfactory. Leo looks at the data interpreter befuddled, sinks its head pondering with a serious face.

  <<timed 3s>>But it is silent. I try to direct-radio them, even knocking on the hatch - which is quite brutally deformed. But no reaction. As I wanted to go befuddled, I hear a whirring, then a cracking sound. The hatch! It opens, but painfully. I guess here was someone hostile. Immediately I reposition myself for better oversight and check around, if the cause for this silence is around.

But boy, oh boy, never had I this much adrenaline! And the silence is more unnerving than an AI informing me what could be wrong.<</timed>>

  <<timed 14s>>Slowly I near the hatch sidewyas, check it from the distance, no movement. So? Does it mean, no one made it? All were deceased, lost, shut down or at other places? With this hunch, I have a better feeling. 
  Then! Inside should be some nutrients and unimatter, I hope! As I enter the spaceship, and went to the central, it informed me that there is no unimatter - although a Substance Analyzer is in the inventory - and no nutrients! Whoa, what happened here?!
  Hold on, no nutrients?! Then. I gotta check.

We again went cautiously to the camp with the dormant spaceship. It is not unlikely that the reason for the spaceship deformations can come up anytime.
The hatch opened as we neared to it. Inside, we plug the nutrients in, and immediately the contents are sucked out and transfered to the cryochambers. There, slowly the machines whirred up to rise the temperatures to a bit, so the awakening biocells are ready for nutrients reception. All still without waking up the consciousness. It will take some hours. Waking up from deep freeze is still a delicate matter.

Meanwhile, I fiddle on the videofeeds.
<div class="dot-enqueuer"><div class="Dot1">.</div><div class="Dot2">.</div><div class="Dot3">.</div></div><<timed 4s>>And yes! It is a brutish big aggressive animal. Weirdly, though, it always attacks on night. Although in the last nights, there were no nightly visits. 
<em>... Huh</em> 
As it knows that there is no more humanly and/or machinely activity. On the night, where the ladies went to deep freeze, it only circled the spaceship, then trotted off.
<em>Uh uh!</em> 
It will come back! I call the Watcher and ordered him to slow down, better: even to revolve back to status ante quo. It accepted. I will come back with enough unimatter in a morning to let the printer here install a defense perimeter. So be it.
 
Right. Auf ein Neues!

<<elseif $QuestPool.includes($Q2B)>>[img[assets/backgrounds/Placeholder.png]]

It feels familiar now. I am getting fond of this place here. If there wouldn't be the knowledge of something lurking nearby, though. But that should not be problem anymore once the defense nodes are entrenched. 
The watcher took the disks in and begins working on it. It gave the notice that the defense perimeter will be finished by the end of the day. And in another day the inhabitants will be out of the chambers.
In two days, then. In two days I could come back. Better with more nutrients, or resettling our spaceship to here.

<<set $dayCount = $days>>

There were greetings. Quite happily. Obviously they were not sure whether they will be found or forgotten for all eternity. A scary thought. Until Solaris may send a rescue - which would take generations, more so as it is not clear that they received the changed status of us being stranded -, our friends and parents may not be anymore. Although, along with our travels, everyone has its own virtual clones of friends, family and soulmates. But, since they are duplicates, it takes up to enormous amount of storage, hence energy is much needed. Obviously, our spaceships do not have these options. So, yeah, they are on our mothership. So, it better not be out this stellar system! Man, that would suck immensely!

Both damsels then are telling me that they are less lucky. 3 others of their crewmates didn't make it since <<= $days>> cycles. Yeah, I guessed by the occupied number of cryochambers. And that there are nightly terrors, by an aggressive animal out there. Of that I also know, and therefore should be no more. They rejoiced and hugged me. Oh boy, that better not awaken in me something.
They further tell me that they had no luck in their decisions before as with collecting unimatter and nutrients, so they had to enfreeze themselves eventually. 
Both now feel rather that we resettle our camp here. They wish more company. That can be arranged.
