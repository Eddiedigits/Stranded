<<set $engineering +=1>><<set $social +=1>><<set $unimatter += 5>>
Vika's spaceship, which is the parent spaceship of our - Leo's and mine - pods, landed upon a clearing in this jungle. Her ride was more smooth than ours. Too smooth by her description, while we almost became wrecks. The AI of this spaceship decided to distribute the risk of losing too many personnel by dispersing us to a wide area. Weird decision, in my opinion. Since we are missing 2 others that our compass doesn't show. Maybe they are what we almost became: wrecks. Everyone should have a compass to reach out to the others, to any others. I hope, we will find out the reason it decided to let us spread out. But for now, the AI is silent. It does sometimes; I have heard, it is to avoid us degenerating our brains, i.e. to keep our neuronal activities steady. I can hope, it - the AI -will  decide to tell us soon enough if our situation turns sticky. Yet, for now, we can assume, there is no imminent danger. Also, it keeps silent about the other stranded. Weird policy.

Alas, what will we do?

<<say "Vika">>Honestly, as a pilot, I can say that we cannot connect to the mothership. In fact. there is nothing but static. So, I conclude the mothership is unreachable or no more. Also, I do not reach the others; the other stranded.
My suggestion is therefore: As we only have 5 unimatter, we print a transmission mast, look for an optimal elevation and reach out to the others..<</say>>

Only 5 unimatter?! That sucks! That means, I have to strategize wisely.

<<say "Leo">><em>groan</em> I would hoard food. What Vika said doesn't sound good. I fear, we are stuck here. At least for a while.
Oh, by the dark universe! Please, give us hope!
Ah, ye'. I would like to repair myself and have a substance analyzer.<</say>>

Oh, I do not have much problems being stuck here for a while. <em>glancing at Vika</em>
But then again ... if we are stuck here for long ... food/energy is essential. A substance analyzer enables us to know which things are edible or can be used as materials, like unimatter.

<<say "Vika">>I agree.<</say>>

<strong>What?! I am the protagonist!

  Elva and Abiba's ship return. It hasn't attacked them. If their watcher knows what that was that attacked us? 

  With jetting forces their ship land on the same spot. The hatch opens, both of them run out and hugs us, asking what that was? What I did? I did nothing.

If you are wondering, how we - in cylinders - are fighting? Well, our exosuits are mostly mechanical, which is still necessary for us to finetune the coordination between brain and limbs. If our AI has the command, then ... well ... let us say ... they have ... what we would call personalities too. Also, in low-data situations, it is down to luck and chance. Better die by my own choice.
And for other reasons, as: to counteract brain degeneration and for energy efficiency.

Such a bad luck! Everything has to be shut down. Our AI is a good for nothing! Or ... you? Or the game designer?

Restart the game from the sidebar, or close the window.

Whatever this was, it killed you. And you don't have a backup. Backups are still too costly in dimensions of human brains; only clones - which are obviously sponsored - from the best brains and genes. You. Are not.
<<else>>

If you reached 30 days, I think, it is enough (for this version). You should have seen all: 
- if all professions are over level 6,
- if you detected Unimatter in the North (2 tiles),
- if you detected the beach in the West (no events in the west, 5 tiles, rather unimportant)
- if you detected the camp in the mountains in the East (4 tiles)
- if you detected the energy balls in the South (3 tiles)
- if you had all interactions with the ladies (8xE, 11xA & 12xV)

Plans:
- more events (more variety)
- one more lady (or more people)
- expanded exploration (more tiles and events)
- possibility to extend, upgrade and manage tech, components and buildings (per aspera ad astra) for finding out the mysteries
- if possible: more events with the current ladies
- sophisticated gameplay (missions, quests, feedback)

You can close the window.

Since, luckily, I had the compass, I did not spend too much energy. Which gave us an optimal total balance (no forgetti! We are practically machines, too) for a fly.
We found two spots on the mountaineous ridge, one for parking, the other one for the antenna. Both in visible distance. 
It didn't take long after the installation of the antenna until we established contact to another group of stranded, but like us, not in a lucky number: 2 of 5.

That's the big spacecruiser. Made for voyaging from Earth to other galaxies. A big Chunker, that one. Many boasted engineering feats werde done to enable a better inter-galactical travel. Hopefully it won't become our titanic. Ha haaa. But, inter galactic travel is still a long journey. Therefore it is practically a ferrying city, with all its typical elements: bakery, cafeteria, park, university, club, city hall, residential area, apartments, restaurants etc. You get the gist. 

What about Family? Friends? In a way they travel with me, as virtual clones. Same with me, a virtual clone with them, updated in cycles. Funnily, if I rather want not much contact, I virtually clone myself. With time they notice, depending how investive they were to me. Clearly, we do not have endless storage, even in the universe.

Come on, that what you see is only the postbot. What tomfoolery would that be to catapult a huge spacewhale out of our solar system from the earthen soil! And no, I am sitting - stacked - in a commuter; on the way to the big chunker that is anchored nearby Mars. The solar constellation is good enough to sling the inter-galactic Hokule'a (or Mayflower) out of solar system. 

If you have noticed. Yes. It is a virgin journey. A galaxis that is not yet established. And therefore not connected to Solaris (the hub of the solar system and an homage to the polish writer). The outpost and further developped colonies in neighbour galaxies clearly get their exchanges by informations, not in materials - or molecules - like in this form of the chunker, this half moon.

Whether the chunker has a name? Enough of reading "big chunker"? Fine, the name of this mobile polymer-ceramic planetoid: Triangulum.
<<timed 52s>><<audio "V7" play>><</timed>>
So. 
In this journey, in the virtual city I will enjoy going out, meet people, have dates. Only to be met by frustrations and dissappointments. And, on top of all, my prof will force me to cram, cram, cram. Äääch! Hippiyay. Too much cramming cannot be good, so I go out anew, meet people, have fun, all as much my hormones allows me. Aaaand the cycle repeats: frustrations, dissappointments, cramming. 

It is a big wonder with our technological advancements that we do not live in an neverending bliss.

<div class="text" style="width:50vw">Hello. Hola. Moin. Salve. 

Huzzah! My first game!

This game is designed for desktop and mobile version. The sidebar therefore is only for rollback, saving, loading and restarting. As I tested a hundredfold, I am satisfied with the outcome. Although I fear, some skewed layout will happen to some of you. Hopefully not you, eh. Anyway, if you want to support me by giving me feedbacks, ideas, suggestions, co-authoring, tips, corrections etc., please do: pi.nola@tutanota.com.

IMPORTANT:

The game has erotic elements. But they are pretty vanilla for me. No fetishes or kinks. And don't get me started with Futas, maldición! So, as obviously, you should be at the age of your country to consume erotica. If you are not, you may enjoy this game by going the SFW-route.


Aside from formalities:

Well then, ancient. Welcome to the future, as it is already now, oldtimer. Ready to play?

  On a spot of a mountainous area, I found others! Yay! I guess, that is why the AI kept passive, because it knew, we will find the others ...

  Both damsels told me that they are less lucky. 3 others of their crewmates didn't make it since <<= $days>> cycles. Both alones make them feel rather lonely. They wish more company. I proposed, if possible, we will set a camp here. The more the merrier. They agreed without hesitation.

  I will go back and tell the others about the new option: the resettling to Camp Mountain.

All pictures of these fine ladies should be seen all by having reached interactibility to around 6.

In case of wondering about the consistency of the images. We living virtual, so we all have preferences about hair lengths, skins, setting, age etc. 
Ah! Whatever, we get the idea, eh?!
...
What do I hear? Excuses?
Oi! No es mi culpa if the virtual composer does not understand my intentions. I mean, even between humans, communicating is hard. 
Listening. Reading. Is. HARD.
So! Take out your contact lenses or your glasses, and all is fine!

Yep, that's me. Handsome, eh? Like a Roman demi-god, no?

Since I come from upper middle class, my family invested in a designer baby. Obviously. But surprise, surprise! Like the mayority of humanity (and pets!), we are synthetic beings, Cyborgs. For better space travel, which this story is about, we have to be cyborgs. Only our brain and spine is completely organic; the rest in synthetic materials.

  On a spot of a mountainous area, I found another spaceship - like ours! Another stranded. 
  
  <div class="dot-enqueuer"><div class="Dot1">.</div><div class="Dot2">.</div><div class="Dot3">.</div></div>
  <<timed 3s>>But it is silent. I try to direct-radio them, even knocking on the hatch - which is quite brutally deformed. But no reaction. As I wanted to go befuddled, I hear a whirring and a cracking sound. The hatch! It opens, but painfully. I guess here was someone hostile. Immediately I reposition myself for better oversight and check around, if the cause for this silence is around.

	<div class="dot-enqueuer"><div class="Dot1">.</div><div class="Dot2">.</div><div class="Dot3">.</div></div><</timed>>
  <<timed 11s>>I see no movement, and no one comes out. Typical AI. Silent since we are on this new planet. 
But boy, oh boy, never had I this much adrenaline! And the silence is more unnerving than an AI informing me what could be wrong.<</timed>>

  <<timed 14s>>Slowly I near the hatch sidewyas, check it from the distance, no movement. So? Does it mean, no one made it? All were deceased, lost, shut down or at other places? With this hunch, I have a better feeling. 
  Then! Inside should be some nutrients and unimatter, I hope! As I enter the spaceship, and went to the central, it informed me that there is no unimatter - although a Substance Analyzer is in the inventory - and no nutrients! Whoa, what happened here?!
  Hold on, no nutrients?! Then. I gotta check. 
  
  <div class="dot-enqueuer"><div class="Dot1">.</div><div class="Dot2">.</div><div class="Dot3">.</div></div><</timed>>
  <<timed 17s>>Oh yes, there are two in cryostasis. Luckily, the energy regenerator on this spaceship is functioning, more or less, which keeps the cryochambers on. Okay, then that means they need nutrients to let them to be released out of the chambers. For that I need a floating Orb, or I convince Vika and Leo to come with me.

<center><blockquote><<if $QuestPool == $Q2A>>[img[assets/backgrounds/Placeholder.png]]

We again went cautiously to the camp with the dormant spaceship. It is not unlikely that the reason for the spaceship deformations can come up anytime.
The hatch opened as we neared to it. Inside, we plug the nutrients in, and immediately the contents are sucked out and transfered to the cryochambers. There, slowly the machines whirred up to rise the temperatures to a bit, so the awakening biocells are ready for nutrients reception. All still without waking up the consciousness. It will take some hours. Waking up from deep freeze is still a delicate matter.

Meanwhile, I fiddle on the videofeeds.
<div class="dot-enqueuer"><div class="Dot1">.</div><div class="Dot2">.</div><div class="Dot3">.</div></div><<timed 4s>>And yes! It is a brutish big aggressive animal. Weirdly, though, it always attacks on night. Although in the last nights, there were no nightly visits. 
<em>... Huh</em> 
As it knows that there is no more humanly and/or machinely activity. On the night, where the ladies went to deep freeze, it only circled the spaceship, then trotted off.
<em>Uh uh!</em> 
It will come back! I call the Watcher and ordered him to slow down, better: even to revolve back to status ante quo. It accepted. I will come back with enough unimatter in a morning to let the printer here install a defense perimeter. So be it.
 
Right. Auf ein Neues! 
<</timed>>
<<elseif $QuestPool == $Q2B>>[img[assets/backgrounds/Placeholder.png]]

It feels familiar now. I am getting fond of this place here. If there wouldn't be the knowledge of something lurking nearby, though. But that should not be problem anymore once the defense nodes are entrenched. 
The watcher took the disks in and begins working on it. It gave the notice that the defense perimeter will be finished by the end of the day. And in another day the inhabitants will be out of the chambers.
In two days, then. In two days I could come back. Better with more nutrients, or resettling our spaceship to here.

<<set $dayCount = $days>>
<<elseif $QuestPool == $Q2C>>[img[assets/backgrounds/Placeholder.png]]

There were greetings. Quite happily. Obviously they were not sure whether they will be found or forgotten for all eternity. A scary thought. Until Solaris may send a rescue - which would take generations, more so as it is not clear that they received the changed status of us being stranded -, our friends and parents may not be anymore. Although, along with our travels, everyone has its own virtual clones of friends, family and soulmates. But, since they are duplicates, it takes up to enormous amount of storage, hence energy is much needed. Obviously, our spaceships do not have these options. So, yeah, they are on our mothership. So, it better not be out this stellar system! Man, that would suck immensely!

Both damsels then are telling me that they are less lucky. 3 others of their crewmates didn't make it since <<= $days>> cycles. Yeah, I guessed by the occupied number of cryochambers. And that there are nightly terrors, by an aggressive animal out there. Of that I also know, and therefore should be no more. They rejoiced and hugged me. Oh boy, that better not awaken in me something.
They further tell me that they had no luck in their decisions before as with collecting unimatter and nutrients, so they had to enfreeze themselves eventually. 
Both now feel rather that we resettle our camp here. They wish more company. That can be arranged.
