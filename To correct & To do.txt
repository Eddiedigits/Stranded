- future possiblities: Beach Camp
- Quest would be a small harbor construction connecting a base (Beach Base?) for building a submarine and underwater probe, potential scenes: beach tanning, xenology,

- DONE: something is not calculating right with the nutrients, check Orb Configuration whether -1 dispatch is indeed zero
- random events with something silvery 1x pic with something silvery
- orb management: give it charting routes
- structurize Task2
- 1x pic of a deformed Camp Mountain
- possible redundancy: $extra3E and $summand
- convert all .png to .webp (save spaces)
- a roar audio for PassTest3E passage, in block/snippet $choice1P3E = 3 (in: AH SHIIET!)

- QUEST MANAGEMENT:
+ more refinements and testchecks
+ Quest 2 is not streamlined

- 3E scenario:
+ a component need to build, or a reconnaissance beforehand, or for a while upgrade the Transmission Mast
+ changed Camp Jungle
+ desintegrating the broken outbuildings to rebuild
+ possible death of Vika if in Camp Jungle and more than 2 days

- unimatter storage:
+ Possibility in Construction Menu

- continue with:
+ AI sounds
+ AI voices

- ideas:
+ flying humans (but drones, and orb already do that, therefore just a interface link is sufficient)
