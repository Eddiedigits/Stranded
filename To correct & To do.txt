- future possiblities: Beach Camp
- Quest would be a small harbor construction connecting a base (Beach Base?) for building a submarine and underwater probe, potential scenes: beach tanning, xenology,

- DONE: Text for installing defense perimeter for the dormant spaceship, not conequential since they have initially 5 unimatter.
- DONE: Replacement for $CMfoodQuest in Camp Jungle

- QUEST MANAGEMENT:
+ more refinements and testchecks
+ Task/Quest2: improve, i.e. extra energy if 3E-Event, Orb OR Vika and Leo for having 9 nutrients at least

- DONE: distorted Menu Button with REST in Camp Jungle

- 3E scenario:
+ a component need to build, or a reconnaissance beforehand, or for a while upgrade the Transmission Mast
+ changed Camp Jungle
+ desintegrating the broken outbuildings to rebuild
+ possible death of Vika if in Camp Jungle and more than 2 days

- unimatter storage:
+ Possibility in Construction Menu

- for future:
+ AI audio generated
+ AI voice generated (although: consistency!)

- ideas:
+ flying humans (but drones, and orb already do that, therefore just a interface link is sufficient)
